# hey, i'm mohamed 👋

**trying to be a student, builder, content creator whilst still trying to have a life**

i'm currently in my final year CS at Imperial (specializing in AI/ML). i don't really go to lectures and spend my time trying to make the most of my uni experience building, writing, meeting new people, creating content and learning new pieces of content

## places i've worked

- **dojo (payments fintech)** — built production features in c#/.net and react that contributed to a ~£10.5m monetization play. learned how to ship under pressure and work in a real product squad. also 2nd place @ company hackathon building an ai data analyst in 24hrs.
- **amazon web services** — sde intern working on distributed systems and ml stuff. i spun up 300 instances at one time to try break AWS, but i got throttled.

## what i'm cooking up

**proposer** — ai-powered mediation for uk tenancy disputes, using rag + knowledge graphs. helping tenants and landlords figure out who's actually right (with citations, not vibes).

**nymb.ly** — imagine when you talk to chatgpt it has full context of what you've done on your browser - we inject more context into your prompts. "context cookies" (parked slightly)

plus 100 random sidequest projects

## tech i actually use

typescript/react/next.js • python/flask/fastapi • c#/.net • aws • sql • java • c++

## other stuff about me

- i make **tiktoks/linkedin posts** about startup building, ai engineering, how to get into tech, and the whole "student → founder" journey. yeah slightly cringe ik but follow me -> https://tiktok.com/@mshar1f and https://linkedin.com/in/mohamed-sharif-stemm

- part of some startup communities (Redwood Founders) and stem muslims -> check them out

## my nindo 
- **build for the people you love**. your vc won't be there on your deathbed. your family will. the late nights, the grind comes back to making a better life for them. that's all you need for motivation
- **agency** - in this day and age, believe in someone that you know will get the job done no matter what
- **give back to your community** - people invested in you when you had nothing to offer. remember where you came from.
- **think about your life from the whys** - why am i in this situation, why do i work so hard, why am i making money, then work your way up and you'll see your world view solidify. 


if you're working on any ai products, dev tools, edtech, or anything -  hmu. always down to provide ideas or collaborate.
